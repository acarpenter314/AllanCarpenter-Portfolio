# AllanCarpenter-Portfolio
My name is Allan Carpenter. I am a beginner game designer. I am married with two kids. I enjoy computer games, playing music (almost all genre), and golf (haven't been playing that long). 
I have been going to college since 1991 at IU in Bloomington. During my time in Bloomington, I was introduced to C language and LPmud gaming (which uses a C-type language called LPC), 
which was ran on unix servers. This helped further my interest in programming but went back home and continued my studies at IU East. Then life got in the way and I lost
focus on what I wanted. Years later in 2018, I went back to college at Ivy Tech and noticed they offer a degree in software development. I hold a Comptia A+ certification, studied for Comptia
Linux+ but did not get certified, have a CT in software development. 
I am knowledgable with Python, C, C++, C#, Kotlin, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Unity, and Visual Studio. Years ago, I did learn Pascal and started working with Delphi, but it is not used must today.
I created a simple game called "Guess the Card" (https://github.com/acarpenter314/Guess-The-Card.git) for android phones for a final project in a mobile application development class. I am currently 
re-creating the game for Windows with better graphics (https://github.com/acarpenter314/Guess-The-Card-Windows.git) (this is not public and is in progress). I hope to do the same with MacOS later. 
I am doing this to learn how to look at code for one platform and be able to understand and write the code in another.
